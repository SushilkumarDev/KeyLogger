# Advanced Keylogger

## What is a Keylogger?

Keylogging refers to the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, often discreetly, so that the user is unaware that their activities are being observed. The individual running the logging program can then obtain the logged data. Keyloggers are most commonly used to steal passwords and other confidential information.

Even Microsoft has openly confirmed that the final version of Windows 10 features a built-in keylogger “to improve typing and writing functions.”

## Types of Keyloggers

There are two main types of keyloggers:

### Software-Based Keyloggers

- Software keyloggers can collect user information without solely relying on keyboard key presses.
- They can log clipboard data, capturing anything copied to the clipboard.
- They can take screenshots to collect graphics-based information.
- These keyloggers can capture text programmatically in applications.
- They also record search engine queries, instant messenger conversations, FTP downloads, and other Internet-based activities, including bandwidth usage.

### Hardware-Based Keyloggers

- A typical hardware keylogger is a device installed between the keyboard and the computer for keystroke logging.
- Hardware keyloggers have the advantage of starting logging as soon as the machine is powered on.
- They operate at the hardware level and do not require software installation.
- The memory size of a hardware keylogger can range from a few kilobytes to several terabytes, with each keystroke typically consuming one byte.

## How to Detect and Remove a Keylogger

Detecting keyloggers can vary based on their design. Generally, a good antivirus or anti-malware scanner can help find and remove them. Poor-quality keyloggers may exhibit signs such as:

- Noticeable degradation of smartphone screenshots.
- Sluggish web browsing performance.
- Lag in mouse movement or keystrokes, or missing characters on screen.
- Error messages when loading graphics or web pages.

Well-designed commercial keyloggers often work seamlessly, disguising themselves as normal files or traffic. Some may even display notices indicating that the system is being monitored, especially in corporate environments. Others can reinstall themselves if users attempt to remove them.

To protect yourself and your equipment from keyloggers, regularly scan your system with a quality cybersecurity program. Effective programs utilize heuristic analysis, signature recognition, and identify typical keylogger behaviors associated with keystroke and screenshot capturing.

## Best Practices for Prevention

To avoid keyloggers, refrain from making common user mistakes that lead to infections. Key practices include:

- Keeping your operating system, applications, and web browsers up to date with the latest security patches.
- Being skeptical about attachments received, especially unexpected ones, even if they appear to come from someone you know. When in doubt, contact the sender to verify.
- Using long and complex passwords, and avoiding the same password across multiple services.

Implementing real-time, always-on antivirus/anti-malware protection is crucial for preventing keylogger infections and other associated malware threats across all platforms, including Windows, Android, Mac, iPhone, and in business environments.
