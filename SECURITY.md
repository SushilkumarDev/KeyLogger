# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is very important to us.

If you have discovered a security issue, please contact us directly at [sushilkumardeveloper@gmail.com](mailto:sushilkumardeveloper@gmail.com). We kindly ask that you refrain from creating a GitHub issue or publicly disclosing the vulnerability. We prefer a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) to properly understand and fix the root cause of the problem.

Your report should include:

- Product version (commit hash or Docker image sha256 digest hash)
- The affected component if possible (e.g., main.py, etc.)
- A vulnerability description
- Reproduction steps

A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix. The fix will be applied to the main branch, tested, and packaged in the next security release.

Thank you in advance for your support in making our products safer!
